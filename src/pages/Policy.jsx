          For safety and security and to ensure you have the best possible user
          experience, we require Users to verify their accounts and might ask
          for your phone number and, in some instances, we might also ask that
          you carry out photo verification. We want to make sure you are not a
          robot! And we also want to avoid fake Winglets accounts being created
          which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they
          threaten the Winglets network and spoil things for everyone. This
          verification might be required by us for the prevention of fraud. You
          can also verify your photo on a voluntary basis (to add the blue
          ‘verified’ badge to your profile).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to verify your profile photo, we will scan each photo
          that you submit. The scan may include the use of facial recognition
          technology so that we can compare the photo you submit to your profile
          photo, to help ensure that you are who you say you are. We do not add
          the verification photos to your profile. We retain the scans so that
          we can verify you in the future and for our record-keeping purposes
          until we no longer need them for such purposes or for three years
          after your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first. After the
          applicable retention period expires, we take commercially reasonable
          steps to permanently and securely delete the scans from our systems.

      <h1>Our Matching Algorithms</h1>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          Winglets’s mission is to create kind and equitable relationships. We
          have developed matching algorithms to predict your compatibility with
          other users so we can show you people we think are a good match for
          you. We use different indications based on users’ profiles on our app
          (for example, how you swipe or whether you match with someone). We use
          these indications to recommend the most relevant profiles to everyone
          to maximize everyone’s chances of finding meaningful connections on
          our apps. Our matching algorithms are based on a range of factors and
          use machine learning to rank profiles for you to maximize your chance
          of finding compatible matches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the following data about you and other users to predict your
          compatibility with others and generate profile recommendations: the
          information you provide us about yourself in your profile such as age,
          distance or gender so we can show you people who are appropriate and
          are more likely to like you back; information about how you interact
          with our app to suggest to you people who are active and available to
          meet new people; and your device coordinates, which are necessary to
          understand your proximity to other members. The legal basis for
          processing profile and proximity information is that this is necessary
          for the provision of our contractual services to you pursuant to
          Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Where we process information about your app
          activity, this is based on our legitimate interests pursuant to
          Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, and specifically our legitimate interest in
          generating more personalized and relevant recommendations for who you
          can match with in our App. Where you have included sensitive
          information in your profile, such as information about your beliefs,
          the processing of this information is based on your voluntary and
          explicit consent.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Moderation Practices</h3>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to
          monitor and review accounts (including photos and any other
          information uploaded onto user profiles) and messages for content that
          indicates breaches of our Terms and Conditions of Use. If an account
          or message meets certain criteria that demonstrate that the Terms and
          Conditions of Use are likely to have been breached, the relevant
          account will be subject to a warning and the user’s access restricted
          and/or blocked. Affected Users can contact Winglets to contest the
          decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you post anything that is inconsistent with our Terms and
          Conditions of Use, we reserve the right to terminate or restrict
          access to your Account.

      <h3>Lawful Basis</h3>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          Under EU and UK data protection laws, we are required to tell you our
          lawful basis for using your data and we have set this out in the table
          below. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at
          any time. Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a
          right to object to our use of your data. We explain in the relevant
          sections in this Policy how you can withdraw consent or opt-out of
          certain data uses (where applicable).

      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          <strong>What we’re doing:</strong> We process personal data to
          understand which of our users may be in college or university. To do
          this, we look at historic location data to understand whether your
          device’s coordinates match to a general university or college area.
          For this activity, we use recent historic data regarding where you
          opened the Winglets app and we’ll keep a simple “at campus yes/no”
          result based on our findings.

          <strong>What we don’t do:</strong> We do not track your real-time
          movements as part of this activity and we do not identify or store
          information about where you are studying. To protect your privacy, we

          <strong>Why we’re doing this:</strong> We’ll combine the results of
          this processing with other relevant information we hold for the
          following purposes: so we can send the right offers, events and
          features to the right users; to understand which Winglets events are
          popular with the student demographic and which aren’t working so well;
          and to improve the design of the App to meet the needs of students.
          The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interests. We
          have a legitimate interest in providing a more tailored app experience
          for student users and in optimizing their chances of finding the right
          connections. Please note this processing only affects Winglets App
          users who identified the United States or Canada as their location
          when registering for the App (we exclude users in Quebec) and who are
          in the 18 to 24 age group.

      <h2>4. OUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE</h2>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you
          have to be at least 18 years old to use Winglets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Winglets does not knowingly collect any information about or market to
          children, minors or anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware
          that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with
          us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to
          terminate that person’s registration.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>5. SECURITY</h2>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          Here at Winglets, we pride ourselves on taking all appropriate
          security measures to help protect your information against loss,
          misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. We use reasonable
          security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal
          information such as secured servers using firewalls.

          Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely
          100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access,
          hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are
          some handy tips to help keep your data secure:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never
            know who may stumble onto your Account!
          </li>
          <li>
            Please don’t share the password you use to access your Winglets
            Account with anyone else!

          <li>Change your password periodically.</li>
          <li>

            the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to
            our site and any transmission is at your own risk.

      <h2>6. INFORMATION FOR BFF MEMBERS</h2>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          If you use BFF, you can populate your profile with information (like
          your beliefs and political leanings). You can provide this information
          as part of your profile, but there’s no obligation to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should assume that whatever information you share in BFF,
          including which Hives you’ve joined, can be seen by any BFF member.
          Please note BFF members will not be able to see chat discussions until
          they join the specific chat and when they join, they’ll see the full
          chat history.

        <h3>
          How we process personal data in BFF and our legal bases for processing
        </h3>
        <p>
          We offer the opportunity in BFF to join Hives built around locations
          or topics. We’ll automatically recommend Hives you can join based on
          your location, activity, “my life” and “my interests” information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of your location data is necessary in order to perform
          our contract with you and deliver the Hives service to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The processing of your profile and activity information in order to
          make Hive recommendations is based on our legitimate interests. It is
          in our legitimate interests to use this information to recommend
          relevant Hives to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that if you upload and choose to share sensitive
          information (such as sexuality and beliefs), you are explicitly
          consenting to sharing that information with other BFF members.
        </p>
        <h3>Profile Sharing on Our Winglets For Friends App</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a member of BFF, your BFF profile will automatically be
          visible both on BFF mode in Winglets and on our separate app, Winglets
          For Friends. Winglets For Friends is a separate app for finding
          friendship and is owned by Winglets Group. We automatically show BFF
          profiles both on BFF mode in Winglets and on our Winglets For Friends
          app to provide you with a richer pool of potential friends to connect
          with. Please note that this profile sharing only applies to BFF
          members in the jurisdictions where our Winglets For Friends app is
          available. If you object to your BFF profile being shown on our
          Winglets For Friends app, please see this help page.

      <h2>12. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION</h2>
      <div className="privacy-policy-content">
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the
          legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as
          permitted by applicable law. Please see “Profile Verification
          Information (Including Biometric Information)” in Section 1, above, to
          learn about our retention policy with respect to biometric
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your Account is deleted, we make sure it is no longer viewable in
          the App. For up to 28 days, it is still possible to restore your
          Account if it was accidentally deleted. After 28 days, we begin the
          process of deleting your personal information from our systems,
          unless:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you

            tax and accounting purposes);
          </li>
          <li>
            we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for
            example, if an account is blocked, we keep some account information
            and a record of the behavior that led to the block - this
            information is retained for evidential purposes in case of queries
            or legal claims concerning the block);

          <li>
            the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests,
            such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users’ safety and security
            (for example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who
            was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a
            new account).
          </li>

          Warning: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete
          your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or
